/// Configuration for the Rustic VFS OpenDAL backend.
///
/// `RusticVfsConfig` holds all settings required to construct a
/// [`RusticVfsBuilder`] and ultimately a [`VfsBackend`] backed by a
/// [rustic](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic) repository. It implements
/// [`Configurator`], so it can be handed directly to OpenDAL's service-builder
/// machinery via [`into_builder`](Configurator::into_builder).
///
/// This config is **rustic-specific** — it is not a general-purpose VFS
/// abstraction. All fields map directly to rustic concepts and are forwarded
/// as-is to the underlying rustic storage layer.
///
/// # Field requirements
///
/// All fields are wrapped in `Option` so that [`Default`] can be derived and
/// configs can be partially constructed (e.g. loaded from a file and then
/// patched). However, some fields are **logically required** and will cause
/// [`RusticVfsBuilder::build`] to return a
/// [`ConfigInvalid`](opendal_core::ErrorKind::ConfigInvalid) error if left
/// as `None`:
///
/// | Field              | Required at build time | Notes |
/// |--------------------|------------------------|-------|
/// | `options`          | ✓                      | Must describe a valid repository |
/// | `backend`          | ✓                      | Must point to reachable storage |
/// | `credentials`      | ✓                      | Repository will not open without these |
/// | `refresh_interval` | –                      | Defaults to 5 minutes when `None` |
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let config = RusticVfsConfig {
///     options: Some(RepositoryOptions::default()),
///     backend: Some(BackendOptions::default()),
///     credentials: Some(Credentials::from_password("s3cr3t")),
///     refresh_interval: Some(Duration::from_secs(60)),
/// };
/// let backend = config.into_builder().build()?;
/// ```
